  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h3>Is this biased?</h3>
  <p>It uses outcome-based criteria — big games, longevity, and adaptability. It’s not “who dribbles better,” it’s “who wins more when it matters most.”</p>

  <h3>Is Messi still great?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely. This just ranks Ronaldo higher under specific metrics like Champions League goals, trophy influence, and multi-league dominance.</p>

  <h3>Why focus on big game performance?</h3>
  <p>Because high-stakes moments decide titles. Ronaldo has repeatedly delivered in knockout rounds, finals, and must-win matches.</p>

  <h3>What about assist numbers?</h3>
  <p>Messi has more career assists. This site weighs scoring impact and moments more than buildup play, though both matter.</p>

  <h3>Isn’t Messi more talented?</h3>
  <p>Talent is subjective — but the goal is to measure outcomes. This site prioritizes total output, adaptability, and decisive moments.</p>

  <h3>Why value adaptability so much?</h3>
  <p>Because the best players produce anywhere, with anyone. Ronaldo’s success in England, Spain, and Italy supports his case for being system-independent.</p>

  <h3>Are you saying Messi isn’t clutch?</h3>
  <p>Not at all. Messi has had clutch games — but Ronaldo has more late-round goals, hat-tricks in knockout games, and last-minute turnarounds on the biggest stages.</p>

  <h3>Is Ronaldo the greatest of all time?</h3>
  <p>That’s up for debate. But this site argues that under these criteria — impact, longevity, clutch performance — the case for Ronaldo is stronger.</p>

  <h3>Can I use this for a project?</h3>
  <p>Yes! Just cite sources responsibly and include your own critical points.</p>
