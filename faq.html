    <!-- ORIGINAL QUESTIONS -->
    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Is this biased?</summary>
      <p>It uses outcome-based criteria — big games, longevity, and adaptability. It’s not “who dribbles better,” it’s “who wins more when it matters most.”</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Is Messi still great?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. This just ranks Ronaldo higher under specific metrics like Champions League goals, trophy influence, and multi-league dominance.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Why focus on big game performance?</summary>
      <p>Because high-stakes moments decide titles. Ronaldo has repeatedly delivered in knockout rounds, finals, and must-win matches.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>What about assist numbers?</summary>
      <p>Messi has more career assists. This site weighs scoring impact and moments more than buildup play, though both matter.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Isn’t Messi more talented?</summary>
      <p>Talent is subjective — but the goal is to measure outcomes. This site prioritizes total output, adaptability, and decisive moments.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Why value adaptability so much?</summary>
      <p>Because the best players produce anywhere, with anyone. Ronaldo’s success in England, Spain, and Italy supports his case for being system-independent.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Are you saying Messi isn’t clutch?</summary>
      <p>Not at all. Messi has clutch moments — but Ronaldo has more late-round goals, hat-tricks in knockout games, and last-minute turnarounds on the biggest stages.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Is Ronaldo the greatest of all time?</summary>
      <p>That’s up for debate. But under these criteria — impact, longevity, and clutch performance — the case for Ronaldo is strong.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Can I use this for a project?</summary>
      <p>Yes! Just cite responsibly and add your own analysis.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- NEW QUESTIONS YOU ADDED (NOW IN THE RIGHT PLACE) -->

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Why does this site use outcome-based criteria?</summary>
      <p>Because trophies and high-pressure moments define careers. Measuring who changes seasons — not who looks better — makes the comparison more grounded.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Does Ronaldo benefit from playing longer?</summary>
      <p>Longevity is a skill. Staying productive for nearly two decades at the top level is part of why many analysts rate Ronaldo higher under durability criteria.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>What about Messi’s playmaking?</summary>
      <p>Messi is one of the best creators ever. This site doesn’t ignore that — it simply weighs scoring impact, adaptability, and clutch output more heavily.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Why do knockout goals matter more?</summary>
      <p>Because knockout matches decide Champions League titles. Ronaldo has more goals in those high-leverage environments, which moves him ahead in this framework.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Does the World Cup change the debate?</summary>
      <p>Messi’s 2022 run was legendary. But this site ranks players across their entire careers — not a single tournament — and Ronaldo has a stronger record in other areas.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Why does adaptability get so much weight?</summary>
      <p>Because performing in different leagues tests consistency. Ronaldo delivered elite output with new teammates, new systems, and new managers.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Is this site anti-Messi?</summary>
      <p>No. It acknowledges Messi’s greatness. It simply organizes the debate around outcome metrics where Ronaldo’s profile is stronger.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Is peak performance more important than longevity?</summary>
      <p>Both matter. Messi may have the higher peak, but Ronaldo’s extended prime and late-career finishing lift him in longevity-based evaluations.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Why doesn’t this site use Ballon d'Or as a main metric?</summary>
      <p>Because the award is influenced by narrative, media, and timing. Objective stats give a more consistent picture of career impact.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Should assists and playmaking be valued more?</summary>
      <p>They’re important — just not the focus here. This site highlights who shapes outcomes most directly through goals and decisive moments.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Is there a version of this comparison that favors Messi?</summary>
      <p>Yes. If the criteria prioritize creativity, dribbling, or tactical influence, Messi comes out ahead. This site just uses a different lens.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="scroll-up">
      <summary>Can I suggest questions for the FAQ?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. You can reach out and contribute new questions based on what you want clarified.</p>
